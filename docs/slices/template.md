# Slice N: Title

## Status

Proposed.

Follow the bounded-review and concise-document rules in
`docs/working-agreement.md` throughout proposal, review, and promotion.

## Product Decision

State the product decision this slice settles.

## User Story

When the user does something, Azurite should provide a complete, dependable
workflow that matters for the product.

## Goals

- New capability this slice makes possible.
- Product behavior this slice completes.
- Architecture or foundation this slice establishes.

## Non-Goals

- Related behavior deliberately left out of this slice.
- Future work that should not be smuggled into this implementation.

## Future Workflow Boundary

Include this section for cross-cutting foundations. Omit it for isolated,
reversible work whose workflow boundary is already obvious.

| Boundary               | Decision                                                          |
| ---------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Current workflow       | End-to-end workflow completed by this slice.                      |
| Predictable extensions | Near-term workflows that shape today's architecture.              |
| Participating layers   | Product layers that own current behavior.                         |
| Near-term seams        | Interfaces required now for those predictable extensions.         |
| Exclusions             | Deliberately excluded layers and the stable reason they can wait. |

## Implementation Plan

### 1. Step Name

Implementation requirements:

- Concrete behavior, data shape, route, state, UI, or test requirement.

## Negative Side-Effect Guardrails

Baseline: `docs/reference/product-guardrails.md`.

List only risks introduced by this slice that need more specific protection than
the shared baseline:

- Concrete new failure mode and the behavior that prevents it.
- New degraded state that must remain visible.
- New migration, integration, or performance guarantee that requires targeted
  regression proof.

## Verification Plan

Map each changed risk or authoritative contract to its smallest sufficient
proof:

| Risk or contract | Evidence                           |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| Changed behavior | Focused automated or manual proof. |

Declare one Sentry impact classification from
`docs/runbooks/playwright-acceptance.md`: direct observability change,
instrumented-workflow preservation, diagnostic-only use, or unaffected. Name
the implemented Sentry contracts or instrumented workflows inspected, select
the required enabled and disabled browser cells, or give the concrete evidence
supporting an unaffected classification.

Run the full repository validation:

```sh
/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm validate
```

Add slice-specific tests and manual QA steps here.

## Acceptance Criteria

- The new user story works end to end.
- The authoritative product and architecture contracts named above are
  represented in code, tests, docs, or a deliberate decision note.
- The linked baseline and slice-specific negative side-effect guardrails remain
  true.
- `/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm validate` passes.
- The repository is clean and pushed on `main`.
