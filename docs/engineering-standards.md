# Engineering Standards

## Purpose

These rules define how Azurite code is structured, reviewed, and verified. The
system architecture lives in `docs/technical-architecture.md`; this document
owns maintainability and implementation-quality policy.

## TypeScript And Module Design

- Use strict TypeScript across apps, packages, tests, and repository utilities.
- Keep `noImplicitAny` enabled and ban explicit `any`; use `unknown`, schemas,
  discriminated unions, generics, or specific domain types.
- Reuse existing schemas, inferred types, helpers, and domain functions before
  adding parallel shapes or near-copy logic.
- Extend shared behavior deliberately and test every supported context.
- Keep filesystem behavior in core, API contracts in shared, runtime handling in
  server, and browser/product UI behavior in web.
- Use TypeScript for repository utility scripts. Add `.mjs` only when an
  external preload or tooling boundary requires it, and document the exception.

## Readable Code Shape

- Keep every code file at 400 physical lines or fewer. Split by responsibility
  before the file reaches 401 lines.
- Preserve both independent enforcement paths: ESLint's 400-physical-line rule
  and the TypeScript `pnpm check:file-lines` repository check.
- Keep functions small, control flow shallow, and names explicit.
- Treat complexity, nesting depth, parameter count, and function length as
  review signals. Refactor when they make the domain behavior difficult to
  understand; do not manufacture indirection merely to satisfy a metric.
- Prefer one clear responsibility per file and function.
- Use human, domain-oriented names instead of abbreviations.
- Document exported package APIs and externally meaningful app contracts with
  concise beginner-readable TSDoc.
- Comment non-obvious internal decisions and invariants; do not restate obvious
  code.

## ESLint Baseline

Use typed TypeScript linting, React rules, accessibility rules, and architecture
restrictions.

The approved numerical maintainability baseline is complexity `5`, maximum
depth `3`, maximum `100` lines per function while skipping blank lines and
comments, and maximum `4` parameters. These signals complement the independent
400-physical-line file limit; they do not replace it.

Type and async safety includes:

- `@typescript-eslint/no-explicit-any`
- the `no-unsafe-*` TypeScript ESLint rules
- `@typescript-eslint/no-floating-promises`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-misused-promises`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-non-null-assertion`
- `@typescript-eslint/strict-boolean-expressions`
- `@typescript-eslint/no-unnecessary-condition`
- `@typescript-eslint/switch-exhaustiveness-check`

General correctness includes `curly`, `eqeqeq`, `prefer-const`, `no-var`,
`no-eval`, and `no-implied-eval`.

React and accessibility includes:

- `react-hooks/rules-of-hooks`
- `react-hooks/exhaustive-deps`
- the recommended `jsx-a11y` rules

Use `no-restricted-imports` to protect monorepo boundaries. Add a dependency
graph tool only when import restrictions can no longer express circular or
feature-level constraints.

Do not enable noisy stylistic rules that fight Prettier. Any local lint disable
must explain why the rule is not appropriate at that location.

### Lint Rule Governance

The committed ESLint configuration is an approved engineering baseline, not an
implementation variable that a slice may relax to make validation pass. Lint
failures do not authorize an agent to add or broaden `eslint-disable`
directives, change rule severity or thresholds, add ignore patterns or file
overrides, modify the ESLint configuration, or weaken the validation scripts.
This remains true when many failures come from numerical maintainability rules
such as complexity, nesting depth, function length, parameter count, or file
length.

Resolve lint failures within the approved baseline when the resulting code has
clearer responsibilities and control flow. Do not manufacture helper
indirection, parameter objects, module fragmentation, or test decomposition
solely to satisfy a numerical metric. When compliance would make the code less
readable, or the volume and pattern of failures indicates that the baseline
itself should be reconsidered, stop the lint-driven refactor and present the
concrete evidence, affected rules, and proposed policy change to Daniel.

Only Daniel's explicit approval for the current task authorizes a new lint
exception or a change to the lint baseline. Apply an approved exception at the
narrowest possible scope, document why the rule is inappropriate there, and
preserve all unrelated lint protections. Treat a project-wide configuration or
validation change as its own reviewed engineering-quality decision; do not
silently annex it to the product slice that exposed the pressure.

## Formatting

Prettier owns whitespace, indentation, wrapping, semicolons, quotes, trailing
commas, JSON, YAML, Markdown, CSS, and TypeScript formatting. ESLint owns
correctness, safety, architecture, accessibility, and maintainability.

### Formatting Exclusion Governance

`.prettierignore` is a project-wide formatting-policy allowlist. Its approved
generated or vendor artifacts are exactly:

- `node_modules/`
- `dist/`
- `coverage/`
- `pnpm-lock.yaml`

Adding or broadening an ignore entry requires Daniel's explicit approval for
the current task. Source, tests, documentation, and fixture directories must
not be excluded to avoid formatting. A verbatim fixture must instead use an
appropriate non-Prettier fixture extension or the narrowest explained local
mechanism that preserves the exact bytes without hiding a directory.

`pnpm check:governance`, included in `pnpm validate`, enforces the approved
allowlist.

## Security And Validation

- Validate untrusted input and output at runtime with shared schemas.
- Treat markdown as untrusted data.
- Keep raw HTML disabled unless a focused capability defines sanitization and
  tests the allowed schema.
- Restrict `dangerouslySetInnerHTML` to an approved sanitized renderer.
- Restrict filesystem reads and writes to the selected cluster boundary.
- Test path traversal, unsafe symlinks, malicious markdown, unsupported HTML,
  API validation failures, and write conflicts where relevant.
- Preserve origin checks or CSRF protection for state-changing routes.
- Keep frontend production console use restricted while preserving structured
  server logging.

## Testing And Verification

Match verification to the change's blast radius.

- Unit-test domain behavior and shared contracts.
- Integration-test API routes, filesystem boundaries, persistence behavior, and
  state ownership.
- Use real browser QA for rendering, editor behavior, history, IndexedDB,
  lifecycle, and responsive behavior.
- Use Codex Playwright Pixel 6 emulation as the standard phone QA path in both
  development and optimized-production builds. A physical Android/Tailscale
  session is optional supplemental evidence only when Daniel explicitly asks to
  inspect behavior the synthetic browser cannot model; it does not block normal
  slice completion.
- Verify both the new behavior and the shared and slice-specific product
  guardrails.
- If automated coverage is unavailable, record the exact manual verification.

The full repository validation command is:

```sh
/opt/homebrew/bin/pnpm validate
```

## Dependency Decisions

Before adding a framework, package, storage layer, or convention:

1. Check the existing repository pattern and reusable code.
2. State the long-term product capability the dependency will own.
3. Compare relevant dependency categories, not only individual packages.
4. Verify current compatibility and important runtime behavior.
5. Record reusable primary sources in the research catalog.

Do not avoid a necessary dependency merely to keep a slice superficially small.
Do not install a platform opportunistically before its product role exists.

## Repository Hygiene

- Preserve unrelated user changes.
- Keep generated output, caches, and local environment files out of version
  control unless the product explicitly requires them.
- Stage and commit only files belonging to the current task.
- Land every integrated delivery on `main` and synchronize the full state with
  `origin/main`. Controlled local editing worktrees are execution-only and must
  follow the ownership, integration, and cleanup contract in `agents.md`.
