# Runbooks

Runbooks contain repeatable operational procedures for existing Azurite
behavior. They are not architecture decisions or speculative implementation
plans.

Current runbooks:

- `playwright-acceptance.md`: operate and evolve Azurite's real-browser
  acceptance matrix across desktop Chrome, Pixel 6, development, and optimized
  production.
- `sentry-debug.md`: enable, operate, and verify the local Sentry debug runtime.
- `tailscale-phone-access.md`: optional physical-phone and tailnet evidence;
  routine phone QA uses Pixel 6 Playwright emulation.

Create a new runbook when a workflow has been implemented and someone will need
to operate or verify it repeatedly.
